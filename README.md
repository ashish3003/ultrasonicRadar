# ultrasonicRadar
Arduino/Microcontroller based Ultrasonic Sensing Radar

Steps:

1. Burn ultrasonicRadar.ino to microncontroller
2. Install python 2.7 and all the other required packages like numpy, scipy, PyQt4, pyqtgraph etc.
3. Connect microcontroller to your computer through usb cable.
4. Do check for port (either /ttyUSB* or COM*). Presently the code doesn't check for the port. This has to be done manualy.
5. Start radApp.py and press "Start Acquisition" to start the radar process.
